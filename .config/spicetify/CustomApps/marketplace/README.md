Customize your Spotify client directly from within [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli)!

Marketplace allows you to **browse, download, and install** extensions, themes, and CSS snippets with ease. You can also browse custom apps, but will need to do some manual installation to get them working.

Made with [Spicetify Creator](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-creator)
